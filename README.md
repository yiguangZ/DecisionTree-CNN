# 🌲 Decision Tree and CNN Classification on Wafer Map Data (ECE 157A/272A)

This project explores both classical and deep learning methods for classifying wafer map defect patterns. It begins with a baseline Decision Tree classifier and progresses to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build and evaluate a Decision Tree model as a classical baseline.
- Design and train a CNN to classify wafer defect patterns more effectively.
- Compare both models' performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing wafer map image data for machine learning pipelines
- Baseline classifier: Decision Tree using scikit-learn
- Advanced model: CNN with PyTorch
- Visualization of classification accuracy and training loss
- Real-world application: Semiconductor defect pattern recognition

## 📁 File Structure

- `ECE_157A_272A_F24_Homework2__1_.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all training, testing, and evaluation code
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for reproducing the project

## 🧰 Libraries Used
